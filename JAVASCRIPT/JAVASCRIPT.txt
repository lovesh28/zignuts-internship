1.JAVASCRIPT:

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

2.What is the concept of JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc


3.JavaScript Variables
In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.

An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

4.JavaScript Comments:
Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".

Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.

5.benefits of let and const:
let and const have block scope.

let and const can not be redeclared.

let and const must be declared before use.

let and const does not bind to this.

let and const are not hoisted.

drawbacks:
var does not have to be declared.

var is hoisted.

var binds to this.


6.JavaScript Keywords:
JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Our Reserved Words Reference lists all JavaScript keywords.

Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:

Keyword	Description
var	Declares a variable
let	Declares a block variable
const	Declares a block constant
if	Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
switch	Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
for	Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
function	Declares a function
return	Exits a function.
try	Implements error handling to a block of statements.

7.JavaScript Display Possibilities:
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log()

8.Hoisting:
Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.

Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:

Example

carName = "Volvo";
var carName;


8.JavaScript Function Syntax:
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
